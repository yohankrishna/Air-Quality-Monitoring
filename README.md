AIR QUALITY MONITORING USING ARDUINO IOT CLOUD & NODEMCU-ESP8266 


The primary objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective, scalable and user-friendly air quality monitoring system that leverages the power of IoT and Machine Learning. The system will provide real-time air quality data and predict future environmental conditions, such as temperature, AQI (Air Quality Index) and humidity.
